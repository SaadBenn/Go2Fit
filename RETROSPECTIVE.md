# Go2Fit iteration two reflection


From the previous iteration, upon group reflection part of what has made our last iteration unsuccessful was the lack of communication and 
effort by some of our group members which lead to total amount of work completed for this iteration to less than desired. Since more of the
work load was put on fewer members of the group this caused there to be some internal conflict within the group. Some members of our group 
attempted to be proactive and tried to communicate that there needs to be more effort by other members of the group, but even after having 
communicated this need the same old pattern continued by some of the group members. 

As a group we only have so much control over the effort of individual members, we attempted to communicate the needs of the group as a whole,
but there is only so much we can do. So, the only concrete way to ensure that work gets completed is to assign more work to the dependable
members, even though this means putting them under more stress. In the real world, members who don’t contribute to the project don’t get the
same luxury as the members of our group. If in the work place a developer was seen as not putting in any effort they would be approached and
told to change. Then if they continue in the same fashion they would simply be fired.
