# Go2Fit iteration two reflection


From the previous iteration, upon group reflection part of what has made our last iteration unsuccessful was the lack of communication and 
effort by some of our group members which led to the total amount of work completed for this iteration to less than desired. Since more of the
work load was put on fewer members of the group, this caused there to be some internal conflict within the group. Some members of our group 
attempted to be proactive and tried to communicate that there needs to be more effort by other members of the group, but even after having 
communicated this need, the same old pattern continued by some of the group members. 

As a group we only have so much control over the effort of individual members, we attempted to communicate the needs of the group as a whole,
but there is only so much we can do. So, the only concrete way to ensure that work gets completed is to assign more work to the dependable
members, even though this means putting them under more stress. In the real world, members who don’t contribute to the project don’t get the
same luxury as the members of our group. If in the work place a developer was seen as not putting in any effort they would be approached and
told to change. Then if they continue in the same fashion they would simply be fired.

A more realistic approach to solving group issues would have been to bring on board more dependable people to help with the group work,
swapping them out with the less than ideal members. Objectively this would have been seen as more successful because the work load would have
been more evenly distributed, this would have lead to less stress being put on all the group members overall. Measurably this would have also
been a success since the project velocity would have been greatly increased. More work being completed by having more members actively
participate in the project.

All things considered, the number of features completed by the active members of our group was impressive. When needed to be done certain
members of our group stepped up and made up for the lack of effort by others. This project could have ended up being a disaster in more ways
than one. But for the time allowed for each iteration, total work done in that time, and quality of the project, As a group I would consider
the application to be successful. As it stands now, the application is at a good starting point and shows lots of potential to be further
developed. We as a group consider that the idea behind the application show real potential to be successful in the real world if further
developed and refined.
